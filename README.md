Beginner project on the caesar cipher generator

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

To use this program, type 'encode' to encrypt or 'decode' to decrypt
Then enter your message
Afterwards, enter the shift number (i.e, by how many positions you want each letter to shift)
Finally, the program will provide the encoded/decrypted text

Note that the caesar cipher is used to encode/decrypt text/letters, not numbers nor symbols. So, any number or symbol will remain as they are in the original message.
